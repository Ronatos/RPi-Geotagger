# RPi-Geotagger
A program written for Dr. Christopher Baynard of the University of North Florida to facilitate taking photos and attaching GPS data on a budget for his students of course code GEO4930.

## Improvements
The logging isn't the best, but it helped me while coding everything out. Additionally, the exits aren't clean. The program ends when you want it to end, but usually via an error, not gracefully.
