  # Sets the interval at which pictures are taken in seconds.
  # 1 second is the minimum value, and is considered
  # extremely fast. You will find
  # that the Pi camera cannot keep up consistently. Occasionally,
  # pictures will be taken in intervals of up to 5 or even 7 seconds.
  # Increasing the interval will not PREVENT this problem,
  # but it will REDUCE the frequency of its occurrence.
  # GPS data will still be attached to the photos successfully,
  # but the distance you walk between photos will be variable.
  # I recommend using the lowest interval you think makes sense
  # for you.
  CAPTURE_INTERVAL: 1

  # Delays the beginning of the program to allow the Raspberry Pi to boot.
  # Measured in seconds.
  # If this value is not set high enough, the program will error out, and
  # no photos will be taken at all. 30 is the recommended value.
  PROGRAM_DELAY: 0

  # Sets the Pi camera's photo resolution.
  # 3280x2464 is the absolute maximum resolution.
  # Lower values are acceptable, and may lead to faster image
  # capturing, but lower image quality is the tradeoff.
  RESOLUTION: 3280x2464

  # Sets the amount of time the script captures photos and
  # GPS data in minutes. This is effectively how long the script
  # is set to run. The only limitation on this value is the size of
  # your USB drive. 
  RUNTIME_MINUTES: 5

  # Camera orientation. Recommended value is 270, but you may change this
  # freely if you feel you need to.
  ROTATION: 270

  # Set this value to TRUE if you have a camera module connected and wish to use it.
  # Set it to FALSE if you do not.
  # The vast majority of the time, you'll probably want this set to TRUE.
  # Only set it to FALSE if you plan on strictly getting GPS data without images.
  USE_CAMERA: TRUE

  # If USE_CAMERA is set to TRUE, this value will be used; otherwise, it will be ignored.
  # Set SHUTTER_SPEED to 0 if you would like the camera to automatically handle this.
  # If you prefer more control over the value, you may adjust it accordingly.
  # SHUTTER_SPEED is measured in microseconds.
  SHUTTER_SPEED: 0

  # AWB_MODE stands for "auto white balance mode". auto is the default.
  # This setting may be set to any of the following presets:
    # auto
    # off
    # sunlight
    # cloudy
    # shade
    # tungsten
    # fluorescent
    # incandescent
    # flash
    # horizon

  # Set this value to TRUE if you have a GPS module connected and wish to use it.
  # Set it to FALSE if you do not.
